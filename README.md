Create an app with a button that changes bgcolor
Create an iOS app with a button that changes bgcolor when pressed

Some ideas to improve the app are:

-Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
-Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
-Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

App Brainstorming

Apps I like - Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and Gmail 

Features I like on that
-Dark/Light mode
-Changing the background color of the messages screen
-Deleting old messages
-Delete messages after a certain amount of time

App Idea - an app that lets user customize the app to the way they want.
